The beauty of Python (and other programming languages) problems is that there are numerous tools at your disposal for concocting solutions. Therefore, the goal of this notebook is not to provide \"correct\" answers, but to expose you to different approaches for the problem. The more tools, packages, approaches, etc. you are exposed to, the more successful you will be in solving diverse problems down the road. It is worth saying that while there are abundant ways to solve any one problem, you should always strive for code that is as readable and simple as possible (without sacrificing functionality or, in some cases, efficiency)."

The values of these features are found under the `Title`, `Author`, and `Recommender` columns, respectively. A book in the dataset can be uniquely identified based on its title and author (it is possible that two different books share the same title, but do not share the same author). Therefore, you need to calculate the number of distinct recommenders for each unique book (or book title, book author pairing). A recommender is identified by name, so you are, in essence, counting the number of unique recommender names for each unique book."

    "The function below produces output different from the one above. It prints out the books' titles and authors according to their recommendation counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "It first makes use of the built-in function [`zip()`](https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/functions.html#zip). This function, which you can read more about [here](https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-zip-function/), takes the values in the `Title` column and the values in the `Author` column and pairs them together. Order is retained such that the first item in each passed iterator (the Title values series and the Author values series) is paired together, and then the second item in each is paired together, etc. Each resulting tuple in the zip object represents a unique book, since it contains both the title and author information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The zip object is passed to a [`Counter`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.Counter) object, which you imported from Python's [`collections`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html) module after running the first cell in this notebook. The Counter is useful for quickly counting elements passed to it. If you pass it a list of elements, it will store the elements as dictionary keys with dictionary values representing their occurrence counts. So when the zip object is passed to the Counter below, the Counter will return how many times each tuple (or book) appears. This is equivalent to counting how many times each book has been recommended, since the dataset has been deduplicated. See [this article](https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-counter/) for some more examples using Counter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function below makes use of another dictionary subclass [`defaultdict`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict) from the `collections` module. A defaultdict is initialized with an argument that represents the default value for the dictionary. In the code below, it is initialized with an empty list. This is useful because you can append values for repeated keys to one value list. Take a look at [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/python-pro-tip-start-using-python-defaultdict-and-counter-in-place-of-dictionary-d1922513f747) for some more insight into defaultdicts and Counters. In the cell below, defaultdict is used to group the books together based on their recommendation counts, with its keys representing the recommendation counts, and its values being the lists of books corresponding with the counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function then feeds the integer argument passed to it into [`range()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range), which is then [`reversed()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#reversed), producing an iterator. Both the integer argument and the maximum recommendation count (plus 1) are passed to range and then reversed, meaning the for loop is restricted to defaultdict keys ranging from the maximum count (which in this dataset is 5 recommendations) down to the integer argument (counts greater than or equal to the passed integer, which is desired).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the function prints out the books with counts in this range in a readable format. To better understand the function below, you may also want to read up on Python's [f-strings](https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/) and read more on [`range()` and `reversed()`](https://realpython.com/python-range/)."

    "Iteration plays an important role in the next two functions shown below. They are presented in this notebook because iteration is often more approachable for people who are newer to programming. However, be wary of iteration, especially with regards to dataframes. It is [generally slow and often unneeded](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16476924/how-to-iterate-over-rows-in-a-dataframe-in-pandas/55557758#55557758).\n",

    "In the `recommender_counter3` function below, the code employs Pandas' [`.iterrows()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.iterrows.html) function, which lets you loop through a dataframe's rows, returning an iterator containing the index of each row and the data in each row as a series. It loops through the dataframe's rows and counts (with the use of Counter) how many times each book appears (which is equivalent to its recommendation count, since the dataframe has been deduplicated). The function then uses Pandas' [`.from_dict()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.from_dict.html), which takes a dictionary object and transforms it into a dataframe, with the option of setting the dictionary's keys as the dataframe's columns or rows. Because the Counter dictionary object is passed to `.from_dict` with the argument `orient='index'`, the Counter's keys (books) are set as the dataframe's rows."
